master - slave - backup
dev1 - dev2 - main

read from db, use files as redundancy.

users (readonly): stored on dev1, read by main and dev2.

items (readonly): stored on main can be read by dev1 and dev2. Settings button to update.

purchases (readonly): stored on dev1 and dev2 (not synced, but timestamp) can be read by main.

(extra: main process purchases and make stats that can be read from dev1 and dev2.)


Store user and purchases as simple files (like it is now) and same time add to tables in appdata.db
appdata.db is then copied using TCP with checksum confirmation

server only accept known ips (should be static anyways)
